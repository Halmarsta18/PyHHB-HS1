# PyHHB-HS1
A preliminary repository for distributing a novel and robust human heat balance model

To improve upon existing methods of quantifying heat stress, Vanos et al (2023) created a novel model of human heat balance (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-43121-5). This model is internally referred to as PyHHB (the Python Human Heat Balance model), but I'm wondering if this should be changed, given that the model could be implemented in other languages just as well. In any case, PyHHB is cool, good, and interesting, so it is high time it be distributed to the public. This practice repository is a place for me to practice using GitHub to share my improvements to this model.
